            Parenting is both challenging and rewarding. Parents often have many questions regarding
            their little ones and online forums are good places for them to look for advice. However, navigating
            through many posts is a daunting task, and our goal is to help them find advice that they need. And
            we need your help!
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            In this hit, we ask you to:
        </p>
		<ol class="subtext" style="list-style-type:decimal;">
			<li>read a post asking for parenting advice,</li>
            <li>go to the link provided below and head to our highlighting interface to read the replies to this post,</li>
            <li>as you read through the replies, <strong>highlight all text spans that give advice</strong>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="par">
            Specifically, an advice is text that the answerer intends the original poster to perceive as
            <strong> a directive to do something that explicitly addresses the poster’s question (to their benefit). </strong>
            Mark the longest contiguous text for each piece of advice. It may be helpful to read the entire text once and only
            after that mark the text snippets describing advice.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Advice can come in a variety of forms, for example:
        </p>
		<ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:disc;">
			<li>Direct advice:</li>
            <ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>Using words such as "suggest", "advise", “recommend”</li>
                <li>Using verbs such as “can”, “could”, “should”, “may”, “might”, “need”, e.g., "<i>you should...</i>", "<i>you need to...</i>"</li>
                <li>Using imperatives, such as "<i>Put baking soda and vinegar down the drain</i>", or "<i>Don’t get worked up because of the tantrum</i>"</li>
                <li>Using questions, such as "<i>why don’t you…</i>", "<i>how about…</i>", "<i>have you thought about…</i>"</li>
                <li>Expressing conditions, for example, "<i>If I were you, I would…</i>"</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Indirect advice:</li>
            <ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>Sentences like "<i>One thing you could do is…</i>", "<i>It won’t hurt to…</i>"</li>
                <li>Hints from personal experiences with the intention for the original poster to do the same thing, for example,</li>
                <ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:square">
                    <li><i>Q: I am having heart palpitations. What should I do?</i></li>
                    <li><i>A: “I also had palpitations. I stumbled upon fish oil that my dad was taking for his heart, and it cleared them out.”</i></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
		</ul>
        <p class="par">
            Please highlight only explicit advice. A good rule of thumb is to see whether the text instructs the
            original poster to do something that would directly solve the question. Here are some examples that
            should NOT be considered an advice:
        </p>
        <ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Expressing sentiment, e.g., “<i>Parenthood: you will never love and hate something so much.</i>”</li>
            <li>Expressing support, e.g., "<i>You are enough.</i>", "<i>It’s totally understandable.</i>"</li>
            <li>Generic argumentation, e.g., "<i>Everyone is responsible for their own deeds.</i>"</li>
            <li>Information-seeking questions, e.g., "<i>How old is your daughter?</i>"</li>
        </ul>
